# Command-Line-Shell
A shell is a program that allows a user to send commands to the operating system (OS) and allows
the OS to respond to the user by printing output to the screen. This shell allows a simple
character-oriented interface in which the user types a string of characters and the OS responds by printing lines of characters back to the screen. 

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cd <name of the directory> | Change the current working directory of the shell|
| pwd | Print the name of the working directory|
| quit | Ends the shell process|
| jobs | Print the name of the working directory. |
| fg <job_id or pid> | changes the state of a job currently in the Stopped state or the Background/Running state to the Foreground/Running state|
| bg <job_id or pid> | that changes the state of a job currently in the Stopped state to the Background/Running state|
